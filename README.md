# Arduino Communication

## 📌 Overview
This project explores different methods of communication between Arduino boards and other devices. It includes examples and implementations of serial communication, I2C, SPI, and wireless communication.

## 🔹 Features
- **Serial Communication** (UART) between Arduino and a PC/microcontroller.
- **I2C Communication** for sensor integration and multiple device connections.
- **SPI Communication** for high-speed data transfer.
- **Wireless Communication** using Bluetooth and RF modules.
- **Practical Examples** demonstrating real-world applications.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### 🔧 Requirements
- **Arduino Board** (Uno, Mega, Nano, etc.)
- **Sensors/Modules** (optional: Bluetooth, RF, I2C devices, etc.)
- **Arduino IDE** (latest version recommended)
- **USB Cable** for programming and serial communication

### 📥 Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Ahhsan/Arduino_Communication.git
   ```
2. **Open the desired example in Arduino IDE.**
3. **Upload the code** to your Arduino board.
4. **Monitor the output** using the Serial Monitor or external devices.

## 📡 Communication Methods
### 1️⃣ Serial Communication (UART)
- Uses `Serial.begin(9600);` to initialize.
- Data transfer via TX/RX pins.

### 2️⃣ I2C Communication
- Uses `Wire.begin();` for master/slave communication.
- Connects multiple devices with only two pins (SDA, SCL).

### 3️⃣ SPI Communication
- High-speed data transfer using `SPI.begin();`.
- Requires MOSI, MISO, SCK, and SS pins.

### 4️⃣ Wireless Communication
- **Bluetooth (HC-05/HC-06)**: Uses `SoftwareSerial` for serial communication.
- **RF (nRF24L01)**: Communicates wirelessly between two Arduinos.
